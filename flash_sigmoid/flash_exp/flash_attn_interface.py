    Arguments:
        q: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads, headdim)
        k: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads_k, headdim)
        v: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads_k, headdim)
        dropout_p: float. Dropout probability.
        softmax_scale: float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax.
            Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim).
        causal: bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).
        window_size: (left, right). If not (-1, -1), implements sliding window local attention.
        alibi_slopes: (nheads,) or (batch_size, nheads), fp32. A bias of
            (-alibi_slope * |i + seqlen_k - seqlen_q - j|)
            is added to the attention score of query i and key j.
        deterministic: bool. Whether to use the deterministic implementation of the backward pass,
            which is slightly slower and uses more memory. The forward pass is always deterministic.
        return_attn_probs: bool. Whether to return the attention probabilities. This option is for
           testing only. The returned probabilities are not guaranteed to be correct
           (they might not have the right scaling).
        sigmoid_bias: The bias to be ADDED in sigmoid attention. If we had
            `q @ k.T / sqrt(d)` as activations earlier, we now have
            `q @ k.T / sqrt(d) + bias`. This bias is now a scalar for the
            entire attention tensor.
    Return:
        out: (batch_size, seqlen, nheads, headdim).
        softmax_lse [optional, if return_attn_probs=True]: (batch_size, nheads, seqlen). The
            logsumexp of each row of the matrix QK^T * scaling (e.g., log of the softmax
            normalization factor).
        S_dmask [optional, if return_attn_probs=True]: (batch_size, nheads, seqlen, seqlen).
            The output of softmax (possibly with different scaling). It also encodes the dropout
            pattern (negative means that location was dropped, nonnegative means it was kept).
